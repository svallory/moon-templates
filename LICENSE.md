If you find this work useful, inspirational, or worthy in any way,
can you take 1 min to send me a shout out on Twitter? It will help me grow and reach more people and **won't cost a penny** :)

I'd love to hear your take on the project, but if you don't have the time
or haven't tried it yet, a simple "thanks", "howdy", or whatever will do just fine.
The link in the note above will even type the tweet for you ;)

Now, here goes the license...
